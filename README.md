# odin-tic-tac-toe

Simple Ruby command line game wherein players take turns placing either an X or an O onto nil spaces in a 3x3 array.

If a player manages to get three of their symbols in a row, across, or diagonally, that player wins. If all spaces are filled, it's a tie.

This project was refactored with a TDD approach. I learned a ton about testing and writing cleaner code in the process of my first TDD project!
